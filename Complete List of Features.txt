    * religions can disappear from a city if that religion cannot spread to the city under current circumstances (e.g. after owner or state religion change) or if too many religions are in a city, higher chances of disappearance right after a new religion has spread to the city
    * religious buildings disappear with their religion
    * new formula to calculate global religion presence
* Non-state religions create additional unhappiness unless you are running Secularism
* Related religions create reduced diplomacy penalties and no unhappiness from non-state religions:
    * Hinduism and Buddhism
    * Confucianism and Taoism
* Spread of religions removes Pagan Temples and replaces it with the temple of the new religion in case it is the state religion
* Christian civs start with their historically appropriate religions unless it is not already founded (e.g. Protestantism for Netherlands, but Catholicism if Protestantism is not yet founded)
* State religion of colonial civilizations depends on the dominant religion in their core
* Religion specific names for all religious buildings

CORPORATIONS
* Corporation headquarters and executives removed, corporations spread on their own to cities that fulfill their requirements
* Corporation spread influenced by amount of consumed resources, civics and buildings in the city
* Silk Route and Trading Company only spread to appropriate historical regions
* Corporations create unhappiness and pollution based on the number of resources they consume
* New corporations:
    * Silk Route (Compass): Silk, Cotton, Incense -> food, gold
    * Trading Company (Exploration): Spice, Sugar, Ivory, Banana, Coffee, Tobacco, Tea -> food, gold
    * Cereal Industry (Biology): Wheat, Rice, Corn -> food
    * Fishing Industry (Refrigeration, Corporation): Fish, Clam, Crab -> food
    * Textile Industry (Thermodynamics): Sheep, Silk, Cotton, Dye -> gold, production
    * Oil Industry (Refining): Oil -> gold
    * Luxury Industry (Consumerism): Gold, Silver, Gems, Marble, Pearls -> gold, culture
    * Computer Industry (Computers): Copper, Aluminum, Oil -> research

EVENTS
* New event: Radiation Leak. Requires Nuclear Plant. Options:
    * Refit the nuclear plant: costs gold, very low chance of nuclear meltdown
    * Ignore the problem: causes unhappiness, low chance of nuclear meltdown, event may continue
    * Abandon nuclear energy: all nuclear plants become obsolete
* Interstate event: now replaces all Roads and Roman Roads on flatland with Highways

STABILITY
* Stability checks are now triggered by certain events (e.g. discovering a technology, changing civics, losing/acquiring a city, starting wars, making peace)
* Stability scores are not permanent anymore, but instead calculated for every stability check (no permanent stability hits anymore)
* Only stability levels are stored: Collapsing, Unstable, Shaky, Stable, Solid
* Stability is divided into five categories:
	* Expansion: overexpansion (population outside vs. inside of core), recent expansion, recently razed cities
	* Economy: economic growth
	* Domestic: happiness, civic combinations, contemporary and outdated civics, religious unity
	* Foreign: vassal stability, defensive pacts, foreign relations
	* Military: war success, war weariness, barbarian losses
* After a check, the stability level can increase or decrease based on your stability score result
* If stability does not improve when on Collapsing, a complete collapse occurs
* Collapse after overextension triggers collapse to core instead of a complete collapse for AI civilisations

DIPLOMACY
* Congresses:
    * Triggered either periodically or when a large war ends
    * Players can claim cities or request to settle free spots
    * After a war, the winners can claim cities from the losers
    * The entire Congress is resolved in one turn
    * When voting on a city claim, camera moves to the city in question
    * If an AI civ is undecided on your claim or a claim on one of your cities, you can attempt to influence them using gold or espionage
    * City assignments by the Congress can be refused, which might lead to war against the civilizations that voted yes
    * Voting AI takes its relationships, own interests and the legitimacy of a claim into account when voting on claims
    * Congresses establish contact between all participants
* General Apostolic Palace and United Nations rules:
    * Votes are now proportional to the square root of your (state religion) population, to give smaller civs more weight
    * When attempting to win a Diplomatic Victory, your own votes and those of your vassals do not count (you need to win a majority among the other civilizations)
    * Resolutions that affect all members do not fail if one member defies it, instead only defying civilizations are not affected
* Apostolic Palace:
    * Elections are initiated by building Saint Peter's Basilica
    * Only civilizations with Catholic state religion are members and allowed to vote
    * Renamed "Declare War" resolution to "Crusade": valid targets are non-member at war with members (defensive crusade) or non-members that control the Catholic shrine or holy city (offensive crusade)
    * Added "Collect Tithe" resolution: all members pay 10% of their treasury, the Pope receives half of it
    * Added "Send Inquisition" resolution: the Pope receives additional espionage against the target
    * Added "Excommunication" resolution: the target player loses membership an receives unhappiness as if they had defied a resolution
* United Nations
    * Only the four civilizations with the highest military power can defy resolutions (Security Council)
    * Added "Decolonization" resolution: cities on other continents can be forced to be released to independents
    * Added "Self-Determination" resolution: if a civilization can be released, it can be enforced by the UN

INTERFACE
* Great People births are announced in the game again
* The terrain tile tooltip and tile stability overlay displays tile stability in five categories:
    * Core (dark green): cities here contribute to your core population, allowing to control more population outside of the core
    * Historical (light green): no penalty for expanding here
    * Contested (yellow): no penalty for expanding here, but risk of a respawn of another civilization
    * Foreign (orange): penalty for expanding here
    * Foreign Core (red): penalty for expanding here, risk of a respawn of another civilization
* Included the UHV progress display in the victory screen from Sword of Islam by embryodead
* The terrain tile tooltip displays when a tile is relevant to one of your UHV goals
* Tooltips display the contributing factors to stability scores in the economy advisor
* Water territory on the minimap is displayed transparently to display coastlines better
* If the first contact between two civilizations triggers a war, the subsequent diplo screen only displays the declaration of war, with no further options that only apply during peace
* The demographics advisor includes a tech history graph
* Civilopedia better displays building requirements (civics, river, water)
* Civilopedia better displays religion requirements
* Notification when a new resource appears or disappears
* Deadlines for UHV goals are also displayed as game turns (default only before Calendar is discovered, but can be enabled for the whole game)
* Current year is displayed during autoplay even for civilizations that start without Calendar
* Disabled the "X turns left" message
* Improved corporation advisor: displays tech requirements, number of consumed resources, factors influencing spread
* New espionage advisor (merged in from History Rewritten)
* Included Platybuilder with additional features to edit and export settler, stability and war maps

* New high resolution waiting cursor
* Removed victory announcement in the middle of the screen
* Included a city name viewer into the World Builder (credit to merijn_v1)

HISTORICAL IMMERSION
* Civilizations are more likely to collapse after a certain historical date
* Christianity is removed from Anatolia when Byzantium collapses
* Mongol Hordes event: armies spawn at their borders when AI Mongolia makes first contact with Seljuks, Persia and Russia
* Predetermined capitals for respawning civilizations
* Seljuk and independent cities immediately flip to Turkey to balance their lack of starting settlers
* City garrisons are pushed out to their owner's capital for certain spawns (e.g. Italy, Turkey)
* India cannot respawn as long as the Mughals are still alive
* AI Russia and America receive settlers or conquerors to reach the American West Coast and Siberian Pacific coast respectively
* AI Greece and Rome receive conquerors to create their historical empires
* Constantinople and Amsterdam start with a larger population and more buildings
* If Buddhism does not exist in 100 AD, it is autofounded instead
* The existence of the Catholic shrine and the Apostolic Palace is guaranteed by the time of the Holy Roman spawn
* AI civilizations receive a free worker and defender when founding a colony
* The capital of AI civilizations automatically relocates under appropriate circumstances
* AI Seljuks and Mughals spread state religion on city conquest
* Islam spreads to Indonesia around 1500 AD
* Semi-scripting to help Chinese city placement
* Wonders in scenarios have the correct original owners
* Religions in scenarios have the correct founding dates
* AI Spain receives additional help in conquering Cordoba

AI BEHAVIOUR
* Conquerors will attack native cities immediately
* Some civilizations (e.g. Arabia, Mongolia, Turkey) fight their initial wars longer and more aggressively
* Reduced intervals between early AI wars
* Beyond declarations of war, AI war maps also influence which cities it tries to capture
* AI war maps also influence which independent cities are targeted
* Discouraged Seljuk and Mongol conquerors from razing cities in the Middle East
* It is harder for far away civilizations to become worst enemies
* Cities will not be founded on food resources anymore
* Classical leaders monopolize less to enable more tech trade in that era
* War and peace with minor civilizations is disregarded when considering to become a vassal
* Minor civilizations will not use nuclear weapons
* Maps are generally less valuable in trades
* You will only be asked to join a war if you share a border with the target
* AIs are willing to trade away their last resource or corporation resources if the trade is otherwise favorable
* AI resource value judgment now includes the overall benefit they or their trade partner receive from a resource, including number of cities
* AI will emphasise commerce for improvements more
* AI will attempt to trade techs more often
* AI will emphasise connecting bonuses and keeping already constructed improvements more

BALANCE
* Several classical wonders are prevented from being built in later eras
* China cannot trade techs it has a monopoly on to reduce the benefit of its UP
* The AI cannot start wonders before the player spawns if they are part of the player UHV
* The AI receives a free civic switch on respawn

PERFORMANCE
* Relocated AI war maps to the DLL to improve performance
* Included an option to ignore UHV checks for AI civs (enabled by default)
* Included an option to enable graphics paging to reduce memory consumption
 * Optimised how persistent data is stored and accessed in Python

* Stealth Destroyers detect Submarines as (presumably) intended
* Cutting contact with a vassal is impossible when there is still contact to their master
* Fixed the Switch Religion espionage mission to have 1000% the previous cost as intended
* Fixed a bug that decreased costs for all technologies in later scenarios
* Fixed a bug that prevented you from receiving multiple techs in the same turn from different sources
